# Fandom Wiki Chatbot (Mach4)
Welcome to the iD Academy Mach4 project for the summer of 2023! This project aims to create a chatbot that provides comprehensive information about your favorite fandom using web scraping and a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) algorithm. The chatbot will be able to answer your queries about the fandom, ensuring a spoiler-free experience.

## Description
The goal of this project is to leverage the power of Python and web scraping techniques to extract relevant data from a Fandom Wiki. We will then use a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) algorithm to process and understand the extracted data, creating a chatbot that can interact with users and provide them with accurate and up-to-date information about their favorite fandom.

## Features
We will use Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape the Fandom Wiki and gather fandom-related data. We also implement an RNN algorithm to analyze the collected data and generate responses for user queries. The chatbot will be designed to avoid providing any spoilers to users. It will be capable of providing useful information without giving away key plot points or surprises.

## Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/id-academy-mach4/fandom-scraper.git
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests tensorflow
```

Navigate to the src directory:
```bash
cd id-academy-mach4/src
```

Run the main script:
```bash
python3 run.py
```

## Tutorial
Once the chatbot is running, it will prompt you to enter your query about your favorite fandom. Type in your question and press Enter. The chatbot will process your query using the Recursive Neural Network (RNN) algorithm and provide a response with relevant information about your fandom. Enjoy interacting with the chatbot and learn more about your favorite fandom!
